This is an exercise to display understanding of Node.JS with Axios.

## How It's Made
** Tech used: ** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.JS, Express and Axios

This challenge uses module pattern coding and to complete exercise requires an understanding of Node.JS, JavaScript and Axios.

## Optimization

Optimizating a better `pixelate()` function. Also how to append to the DOM with less HTML tags.

## Lesson Learned

Understanding the requirements of the project. What pieces of functionality is missing? Understanding the code pattern? Running test to see the code breaking and then responding to those errors. Console.log() helped in this matter and mapped a picture of data flow happening.
